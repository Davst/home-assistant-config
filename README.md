*Hello! 您好！Hola! Bonjour! Goedendag! नमस्कार! Hallo! Olá!*

First and foremost thank you for finding you way to my Home Assistant repo. This is the Home Assitant configuration for our smart home. I've been using Home Assistant now for a little less than a year (not so long) now, and it has brought me a huge amount of joy! This repo is to help inspire and find ideas about a smart home! Enjoy!
