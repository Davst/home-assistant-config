*Hello! 您好！Hola! Bonjour! Goedendag! नमस्कार! Hallo! Olá!*

First and foremost **thank you** for finding you way to my Home Assistant repo. This is the [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) configuration for our smart home. I've been using Home Assistant now for a little less than a year now (not so long), and it has brought me a huge amount of joy! This repo is to help inspire and find ideas about a smart home! Enjoy!
