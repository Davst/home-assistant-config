## Introduction

*Hello! 您好！Hola! Bonjour! Goedendag! नमस्कार! Hallo! Olá!*

First and foremost thank you for finding you way to my Home Assistant repo. This is the Home Assitant configuration for our smart home. I've been using Home Assistant now for a little less than a year (not so long) now, there was times where I was anxious, but there was other times where I was proud, when automation that I've been working on triggers. This repo is to help inspire and find ideas about a smart home! Enjoy!
