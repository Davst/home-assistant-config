***Hello! 您好! Hola! Bonjour! Goedendag! नमस्कार! Hallo! Olá!***

***View on GitHub pages (https://n-l1.github.io/home-assistant-config/)***

First and foremost **thank you** for finding you way to my Home Assistant repo. This is the [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) configuration for our smart home. I've been using Home Assistant now for a little less than a year now (not so long), and it has brought me a huge amount of joy! This repo is to help inspire and find ideas about a smart home! Enjoy! 

### Lovelace UI
Lovelace is the primary interface for Home Assistant, it is used to display all sorts of information. My take on Lovelace is for it to be simple, although it might be cool to know if th [ISS](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/iss/) is above your house, it is definitely unnecessary.
