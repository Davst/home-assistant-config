## Introduction

First and foremost **thank you** for finding you way to my Home Assistant repo. This is the [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) configuration for our smart home. I've been using Home Assistant for a little less than a year now (not so long), and it has brought me a huge amount of joy! This repo is to help inspire and find ideas about a smart home! **Enjoy**! 

**For now this repo is only forcusing on the Lovelace UI**

## Lovelace UI
Lovelace is the primary interface for Home Assistant, it is used to display all sorts of information. My take on Lovelace is for it to be **simple**. I'm trying to make it easy for **you** to implement my UI into yours! Look below for further details. 

My theme of the UI is based on [Soft UI](https://dribbble.com/shots/8027871-Soft-UI/attachments/531358?mode=media)
